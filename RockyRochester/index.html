          <h5 class="card-title">History</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Rocky The Raccoon began as the Rocky Rochester's mascot when most of the band met in college. They would stay up late and go out on car rides. Once they started thinking about creating a band John the guitarist spotted a raccoon outside Nick Tahou Hots that the four members always ate at. He instantly created a children's song based on that raccoon and since it described their band so much from their nocturnal behavior and eating garbage plates they thought it would be the best mascot that represented them as a band and something fun to remind them of their days together as students. </p>
          <h5 class="card-title">Events</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Rocky The Raccoon will be present at every concert event. Please visit the events page to learn more about when concerts take place.</p>
